This may have shown them that they weren't as far along in developing a workable atomic weapon as they had thought.\"",

China joined in the moderate sanctions that were adopted at the U.N., it joined the banking sanctions in Macao that the U.S. had encouraged, and it apparently cut some military aid to North Korea and threatened further cuts. All this showed that the Chinese, like the Bush Administration and the Japanese, were concerned about the prospect that North Korea could become a full fledged nuclear power.\"",

We then package these gifts in cellophane with a ribbon. Everyone really loves them and they make a nice ecological gift to the birds."

I was seated next to the woman and I noticed that as she put her head back into the bus, there was an expression of surprise and regret on the face of the bus conductor. A hand appeared from outside and was on the woman’s neck. The woman held on to the gold chain on her neck but the guy who later showed his face was faster.

Legislators and presidents will continue to protect state-sanctioned abortion as long as they perceive it to be in their political self-interest. Inner city neighborhoods will continue to be wracked by murders and drugs as long as everyone thinks “that is not my problem.” In other words, the culture of death will continue to flourish as long as we collectively allow it to by remaining indifferent, by feeding it our entertainment dollars, by accepting violence as normal, by not articulating and proclaiming the Gospel of Life. Peace, respect, reconciliation and justice are hard work and can only be sustained by a proper understanding of the human person as worthy of absolute respect, as the proper end of all human activity. All violence, scape-goating and victimization end in the cross of Jesus Christ. By surrendering himself to death, the Son of God subverts all forms of human manipulation, the using of another for one’s own selfish gain. Where the culture of death takes the life of another for some perceived gain, Jesus offers his life, so that we can all gain together the saving love of God and the reconciliation of a world redeemed. The Gospel of Life offers us a breath-taking vision of human flourishing, solidly rooted in the proper understanding of the person, created in the image and likeness of God, redeemed by the Son and sanctified in the Holy Spirit. We pray for the many victims of violence and we commit ourselves to the culture of life.",

            "MegaMagnum systems require half of the floor space compared to a rack with 8-in. membrane elements. A single 18 x 61 in. MegaMagnum spiral element contains 2,800 sq. ft. of membrane surface area, compared to 400 sq. ft. in commonly deployed 8 x 40 in. products. The number of elements used in a MegaMagnum system is one-seventh the number of elements needed to produce the same water quantity and quality at the same fouling rate in a standard system with 8-in. elements operating at similar fluxes and pressures. This gives an 80% reduction in the required number of connections and O-rings, thereby increasing reliability and further reducing costs.",

            "Economist David Rosenberg believes the bond market is getting inflation right and yields shouldn’t trade at higher levels. His reasoning: Inflation as a temporary phenomenon caused by enormous pent-up demand and supply chain issues connected to the coronavirus pandemic. “The numbers have been shocking to the upside, no doubt about it. But it’s pretty easily explainable,” the Rosenberg Research president told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday. “I don’t understand why people want to superimpose these last couple of months into the future.” So far, the bond market is shrugging off inflation.",
            "In a note to investors on Friday, he wrote “I refuse to hyperventilate over inflation.” He believes the other side of surging growth is a plateau. “That’s the story for the second half of the year… The bond market is sniffing that out right now,” Rosenberg said. “My forecast is slower growth, inflation peaking out and rolling over and a bull flattening in the yield curve.”"

            "The new school term began on January 4, and at this time I was ready to introduce two new projects to Saint Paul's Primary School based on what I have observed, and how I felt I could best be of service. The first is in conjunction with the community organization I am paired with, St.Paul's Family Initiative. It is a literacy project that aims to promote family bonding through reading. Basically I spend a couple of hours each week in the classrooms doing an interactive story hour. Sometimes I read to the students, sometimes they read to me or to each other. I ask question and hold discussion to check for comprehension, and the kids really enjoy the books! I then encourage them to keep reading at home by facilitating library check-outs. Each week they get a book to take home and read with their parents, and when they bring the books back to class, I give them a chance to tell us about the story.",
            "The second project I introduced this month is one that is really near and dear to me, definitely my pet project. It's an after school girls group, and I feel so strongly about it, that it is difficult for me to articulate why I think it is so important, but I just know that it is. I started this group at two different campuses, with the idea that I could provide these young women with a safe and healthy environment in which to explore issues that are specific to them. Our projects will focus on body image, leadership skills, dating & sex, challenges at home, goal building, health & wellness, etc."

            "However, when Zogby Research Services (ZRS) polled in Arab countries in late 2011 we found that public opinion was less certain. For example, when we asked citizens in Egypt, Tunisia, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and UAE, whether they believed the Middle East was better off or worse off as a result of the Arab Spring the responses were largely divided between those who said that, to see what the Arab public now felt about the “Arab Spring”. This finding, which will likely be rejected by some, matches the results found by other polling companies and continues the upward climb in the Brotherhood’s ratings in polls we have conducted in Egypt in the last two years. It doesn’t necessarily translate to a measure of the group’s popularity as it does to a growing uneasiness with the current trajectory of developments in Egypt. Evidence of this unease can be found in responses we received when we found Egyptians divided as to whether the situation in their country had become better or worse since the beginning of the Arab Spring—30% said “better” and 29% said “worse”.",

            "Lone-wolf operations refer to retaliatory attacks by individuals having deep grievances resulting from overwhelming oppression. Such attacks are almost impossible to categorize or systematize, let alone forecast. It is very hard to predict when and where they will happen. This type of attacks occurs from time to time in occupied Palestine, especially when the level of Israeli repression of Palestinians reaches exceptionally high levels. The attacks usually assume several forms, including, inter alia, stabbing with a knife or a similar sharp tool, hitting with a metal object, running over soldiers or settlers using vehicles (vehicular attacks). Most Palestinians feel such attacks are inevitable if not legitimate due to overwhelming Israeli repression, which includes cold-blooded murder outside the law as well as hefty jail sentences disproportionate to violations committed. Palestinians are also subject to draconian punishments and reprisals including home-demolitions, land confiscation...",

            "Prone Mountain begins, as the name implies, on the belly. Start with your hands flat on the floor with your wrists beside the lower ribs. Many people find their head falling into the floor, while their chest is off the floor – this is the head-forward posture revealing itself. To build better posture, bring your chest as close as possible to the floor (flesh of the chest firm against the floor) while simultaneously lifting your nose and chin slightly off the floor. To fully realize the benefits for the spine, extend out through the crown of the head, while at the same time, stretching back through the outstretched toes. By practicing Prone Mountain in this way, you gently remind the body of its optimal spinal alignment, while building the core postural strength to help maintain good posture.",
            "Return to Prone Mountain and find the optimal spinal alignment we explored earlier, and bring your attention to the shoulders. Very often at the very mention of shoulders, people reflexively pull them back to the spine. Yes, the chest is more open, but at what cost to the back lungs? Remember: the torso is three-dimensional. Opening the chest by compressing the back is a zero net gain. The optimal posture opens both front lungs and back lungs at the same time."

            "If you wish to buy Persian rugs or Oriental rugs, it is essential that you understand the different manufacturing designs that you are most likely to experience in these great living room rugs: Hand knotted– These are by far the most fancy and expensive living room rugs. Hand knotted rugs are, as the name recommends, made completely by hand using an unique loom. Each piece of wool, silk or cotton utilized in the manufacture of hand knotted rugs are tied by hand. As a result of this tedious over time. If you buy a hand knotted Oriental rug today, for example, you might likely market it in the future and recuperate most or all of your initial purchase price. Hand tufted – A hand tufted rug is one that uses a hybrid manufacturing procedure that utilizes both an experienced craftsman as well as a maker. While the finished item looks just like a hand knotted rug, they can be made far more rapidly and cost effectively. A hand tufted rug has a canvas support, which makes it simple to identify from the more expensive hand knotted range. While hand tufted living room rugs are rather appealing and are made to last for many years, they do not attract attention from collectors, and have little or no resale value.",

One aspect of the work centres on what she finds in this space, the resources she has at her disposal there, and the way she moves in it. Beyond that, it is also about the space of production in which the photographic image appears, about the processes involved—and thus the formal decisions that she makes as an artist. And it is about the space of ideas, the intellectual exploration, in other words, that she incorporates into her work. All these different facets provide the structure for Bielau’s work—and she is not alone here—and have led her to this specific work, whose title, which is both succinct and profound, encapsulates what working as an artist is all about: transforming an idea into a concrete piece and then showing the work in exhibition."

            "A coffee and tea shop opened up in Beverley, near us, recently. Naturally I got all excited and had to charge in at the first opportunity. So, I checked it out. It seems to stock mostly flavoured teas and coffees with few ‘proper’ teas. Shame that. The place seems like a step up from Whittards, but not so much to my taste. Unfortunately, this tea I bought from there is the same. I have tried it with different amounts of leaf, at different temperatures and varied the steeping time. It tastes like a Darjeeling, but only just and the variable elements don’t seem to change it much. It is certainly not a patch on the other Darjeelings that I drink more regularly, but then it is cheaper too and that shows in the taste. Shame about that. I had hoped for a regular source of everyday tea but this one is not it. Perhaps the shop has others that are better …",

            "Mathys Kauffmann of Kriegstetten, Solothurn, Switzerland, was one of the Anabaptist preachers held in chains in the newly built penitentiary and orphanage in Bern, who were considered \"the most important preachers and ringleaders\" (see Bern). From 3 March 1659 to 10 September 1660, Kauffmann was there. Efforts of the council and the clergy to convert him were in vain. On 20 January 1660 the appointed persons \"betook themselves to the Anabaptist business\" in the penitentiary to give the Anabaptists an examination. On 16 points the prisoners had to give an account, covering doctrine, communion, baptism, and attitude to government. All remained true to their convictions. Kauffmann had been seized at Koppingen in the canton of Bern, at his daughter's home. Now he besought the council to release him because he wanted to go to Solothurn. According to a decision of the council of 15 June 1660, the prisoners were to be banished. On 27 August they were again cross-examined, but they still \"persisted in their opinion, no matter what one tried with them.\" Kauffmann was then taken to the border via Brügg with the others on 10 September 1660 and banished."

            "\"A member of the audience shares some thoughts about The 3rd season Stranger Things at IMDB: ¨Season 3 was garbage. It seemed like the writers were tasked to see what people liked about the show and just fill the story line with them. It had excessive use of brands. The 80s music were just injected every where for no reason: every time a person entered the scene, 80s music was blasting loudly. Dialogs were extremely predictable and cheesy. Each character's personality was unnecessarily exaggerated: Hopper is always angry and unreasonable, Erica was constantly sassy but the smartest person ever, the mayor is the worst person in the world, the whole newspaper crew were excessively mean. And finally, the whole plot with the Russians was cheap and not at all well thought out. It was hard to finish the season really.¨\""

            "The biggest difference between C++ and Java can pretty much be described as one thing: memory management. The handling of available memory is almost completely abstracted away when using Java, you only have to worry about not overloading the device you’re developing on, which is rarely a problem when developing desktop applications. In C++, however, the allocation of memory is done for you, but releasing it is not.",

With your teeth being constantly subjected to the force of your bite, grinding may wear the teeth down and cause it to become prone to fracturing.

Grinding your teeth also abrades and weakens the enamel often causing the dentin to be exposed, making the teeth more susceptible to dental decay and fracture.

Once heard, for all the right reasons Edgar’s singing is never forgotten.",

They provide the perfect backdrop for Edgar’s powerhouse singing.",

            "'Identification and Characterization of the Zinc Uptake Regulator (Zur) of Corynebacterium diphtheriaeRegulation of metal ion homeostasis is essential to bacterial cell survival and in most species is controlled by metal-dependent transcriptional regulators. In this study, we describe a Corynebacterium diphtheriae ferric uptake regulator-family protein, Zur, that controls expression of genes in response to available zinc. Although no growth phenotype was observed in differential metal conditions, a C. diphtheriae zur mutant was more sensitive to peroxide stress, suggesting that Zur has a role in protecting the bacterium from oxidative damage. By measuring promoter activities and mRNA levels, we demonstrated that Zur represses transcription of three genes, zrg, cmrA, and troA, in zinc replete conditions. Zrg and TroA have similarity to other proteins involved in zinc uptake such as Bacillus subtilis YciC and Treponema pallidium TroA, respectively. CmrA has the highest similarity to C. diphtheriae TroA. Transcription of zrg and cmrA was also regulated in response to iron and manganese, respectively, by mechanisms that are independent of Zur. In addition to these three genes, 74 genes were shown to be affected by the absence of Zur and zinc via microarray analysis of transcript levels. The microarray results were confirmed via qRT-PCR for six of these genes, including one that is seemingly activated by Zur. An adjacent gene to zur, predicted to encode a metal-dependent transcriptional regulator in the ArsR/SmtB family, is transcribed from a separate promoter whose activity is unaffected by Zur. In contrast, Zur represses the activity of the zur promoter under low zinc conditions. The observed unique regulation of zur transcription has not been described for any other Zur ortholog. In addition, Zur bound the upstream region of multiple genes with varying affinity and this binding was metal dependent. A Zur binding site was determined on the upstream region of zur, cmrA, and sidA using a Dnase I protection assay. Our studies provide the first evidence of a zinc-specific transcriptional regulator in C. diphtheriae and give new insights into the intricate regulatory network responsible for regulating metal ion concentrations in this toxigenic human pathogen.'",

            "In his Interfaith Youth Core, Eboo has taken these principles and engaged a young audience with the assertion that they must take responsibility for their world by purposefully participating in it. This sense of communal accountability, before God and to one another, while at the heart of the Catholic faith, is lost in practice. In my experience, young Catholics are dropped off at Confirmation and picked back up at Marriage. A lifetime worth of moral decision making and vocational discerning takes place in those ‘Odyssey Years’ as David Brooks has called them. But if you’re not a saint, and not considering the priesthood (or ineligible for it), it’s far too easy to get lost in the shuffle. I threw myself at parishes, taught religious education for years, served as a lector, altar server and RCIA sponsor. But there was no system in place to connect me to the larger parish community. Without an interest in a lifetime of celibacy and lacking a family of my own, I was treated as an aimless free radical. But mostly, I was ignored.",

Its foundation rests on the employment of the energy of its youth, passing young people from one age-appropriate youth group to the next and channeling their idealism towards service and mission work. At its best, that strategy builds healthy, intentional and charitable human beings. There is no Catholic equivalent. That is a tragedy."

            "Electric bikes are becoming increasingly popular. While electric bikes require less energy to ride than a conventional bike, they’re no less beneficial for your health according to recent studies. The main reason why electric bikes, or ebikes, are just as beneficial for your health is because you’re more likely to use them regularly than traditional bikes. Plus, even though ebikes have a motor, you still need to peddle if you want to go faster than 4.5mph. If you’re recovering from an injury or have a long-term problem – such as bad knees – that means you can’t ride a conventional bike, you might find that an ebike allows you to ride without experiencing any discomfort. Plus, asides from the health benefits, electrical bicycles are much more environmentally-friendly than cars, motorbikes and public transport.",

Primary concern was blood in my urine, but can't at this time verify that this medication is the cause...but it is highly suspected by me. I’ll call doc tomorrow to report my findings. I am told that taking Warfarin (Coumidin) along with this drug may have caused some of the problems. This was not an issue that was expressed in the literature. I won’t be taking any more.... unless it can be proven to me that these problems as listed above are not associated with the \"Amio\". I hope I don’t die tonight from internal bleeding in my kidneys.

Stranger melds Gwartney’s memories of her childhood in the small town of Salmon and in Boise, Idaho with the real-world tale of Narcissa Whitman, a white woman settler who was killed by the Native Americans she was attempting to convert to Christianity. For Oregon Trail lovers, Whitman was the first white woman documented to have crossed the Rockies. “As a result, the book reflects not only Gwartney’s feelings of loving Idaho but also her feeling that she didn’t fit in there either. In a family that hunted — claiming to fame being part of the killing of Idaho’s last wolves before they were reintroduced — she’s left-leaning and has never fired a weapon. Stranger also contains a sense of the modern-day ambiguous feeling of loving the West but seeing ourselves as interlopers.”"

            "One of the most influential designs of recent decades and an outstandingly successful rally car, the Audi Quattro brought four-wheel drive into the motoring mainstream. Introduced in 1980, the Quattro was based on the outwardly similar Coupé’s bodyshell but used a different floor pan to accommodate its four-wheel-drive transmission and independent rear suspension. The engine was a development of the five-cylinder, 2.1-litre, single-overhead-camshaft unit first seen in the 200 saloon. Equipped with a KKK turbocharger, it produced 200bhp in road trim with considerably more being available in competition tune.",
            "Phenomenally fast and sure-footed on the road, the Quattro excelled in international rallying, winning the Manufacturers’ Championship for Audi in 1982 and 1984 and the Drivers’ Championship in 1983 and 1984, but its enduring legacy would be the demonstration of four-wheel drive’s advantages for passenger cars. Since then Audi has gone on to apply its Quattro 4WD system to many other models but only the original (or ‘Ur’) version is spelled with a capital ‘Q’."

            "Tim Hunter sent me this interesting paper by sociologist Kieran Healy that argues against nuance as a theoretical virtue. The title, “Fuck Nuance” tersely provides the paper’s main conclusion. It is a paper that linguists might find interesting for, IMO, many of the vices that nuance has wrt sociological theory carry over pretty directly to theory within linguistics. Indeed, as Healy argues, nuance is often the scourge of theory. Healy describes it as follows: It is the act of making—or the call to make—some bit of theory “richer” or “more sophisticated” by adding complexity to it, usually by way of some additional dimension, level, or aspect, but in the absence of any strong means of disciplining or specifying the relationship between the new elements and the existing ones. Theorists do this to themselves and demand it of others. It is typically a holding maneuver. It is what you do when faced with a question that you do not yet have a compelling or interesting answer to. Thinking up compelling or interesting ideas is quite difficult, and so often it is easier to embrace complexity than cut through it.",
            "I am very sympathetic to Healy’s observations. Indeed, I think that I am on record lamenting this tendency within current linguistic theory (see here). Rare is the paper or interaction where theoretical profligacy is resisted and a data point or two left stranded in the deductive wilderness. Indeed, tolerance for “counter-examples”[1] is taken to be sure evidence of scientific felony, and to forestall such a charge we lard our papers and stories with ad hocry that serves to both obscure the interesting explanatory points being made and to confuse us into mistaking description for explanation. One of the virtues of the early Minimalist papers was to warn against this tendency, alas to little apparent effect. What makes this truly unfortunate is that these demands, as Healy notes, have baleful results."

A resolution on alcohol-sales licensing within the city that would ask state legislation to a) eliminate special licensing provisions for Takoma Park, so that Montgomery County licenses would apply here, retaining special licensing only for certain businesses in the portion of Takoma Park annexed to Montgomery County from Prince George's; b) include Takoma Park in licensing for sales of house-brewed alcoholic beverages (which would be redundant if (a) passes); and c) supports an end to Montgomery County's alcoholic-beverage distribution monopoly. This legislation would answer the TPSS Co-op's desire to sell beer and wine and Republic's wish to sell house-brewed beer but would apply throughout Takoma Park.\\n. An ordinance (establishing city law) regulating commercial filming activities in the city, necessitated by increasing demand and by abuses by a particular company, Sirens Media of Silver Spring.\\n. A resolution authorizing execution of an agreement for a Maryland Bikeways Program grant. We've done well at winning outside funding for transportation programs. This grant is the latest example.\\n. A resolution communicating city attitudes toward development of the wooded lot, part of the Washington-McLaughlin Christian School property, which is up for IRS auction on January 22. The consensus is that the city would like to see the majority of the parcel conserved undeveloped; the city council will be strengthening the draft you see online.\"",

Thus patients most often are placed far too quickly in a diagnostic niche with very little appreciation of the complexity of their difficulties and are often given those medications which fit the criteria of drug company concepts of treatment.",

            "Robert’s moodiness also continued. Robert has always had angry outbursts (one time when he lived in an assisted living facility he yelled for the nurse to “go to hell.” When I talked to him about it he insisted he just said that in his head and certainly wouldn’t say that out loud!) Those outbursts are infrequent. Now they are an almost daily occurrence. Robert gets angry at anyone and everyone – us, the transport drivers, the Day Program staff, the respite staff and the dogs. He is hypersensitive to everything: noise, water temperature – even his gums are sensitive. In addition to all of this, Robert developed excessive saliva which was not helping his congestion problem. He even choked a few times on it! Yikes! The narrative indicates challenges related to a complex interaction of physical health issues and mental health conditions.",
